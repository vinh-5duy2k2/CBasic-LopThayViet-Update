// Exercise
// • Write a program to build a 
// tournament: a binary tree where 
// the item in every internal node is a 
// copy of the larger of the items in its 
// two children. So the root is a copy 
// of largest item in the tournament. 
// The items in the leaves constitute 
// the data of interest.
// • The input items are stored in an 
// array.
// • Hint: Uses a divide and conquer
