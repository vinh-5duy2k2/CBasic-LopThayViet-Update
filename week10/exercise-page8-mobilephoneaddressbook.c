//Exercise
//• We assume that you make a mobile phone’s address book.
//• At least, we want to write a program that can store about 
//100 structure data with name and phone number and email address.
//• Read about 10 data from an input file to this structure, and 
//write the data that is sorted in ascending order into an 
//output file.
//• Use the insertion sort and selection sort
//• (1) Write a program that uses array of structure 
//• (2) Write a program that uses singly-linked list or doublylinked list.
//• In both program, print out the number of comparisons 
//made during the sorting process of each algorithm.
