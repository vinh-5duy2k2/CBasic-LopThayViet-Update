/*
Exercise
• We assume that you make a mobile phone’s address book.
• At least, we want to write a program that can store about 
100 structure data with name and phone number and email address.
• Read about 10 data from an input file to this structure, and 
write the data that is sorted in ascending order into an 
output file.
• Use the insertion sort and selection sort
• (1) Write a program that uses array of structure 
• (2) Write a program that uses singly-linked list or doubly linked list.
• In both program, print out the number of comparisons 
made during the sorting process of each algorithm.
